# yatc
Yet Another Translate Client

This simple bash script was written due to new problems with official Google Translate API (now it's requires to enter a captcha which is not useful in many cases). So I as a long-term user of Opera Mini decided to realise my proposition to use as a backend the dumbphone version of Google Translate as it's pretty simple and uses simple GET requests and HTML responses.

Copy this script to you /usr/bin directory and start using. The command format is much simple:

`yatc en=ru "make a barrel roll"`
